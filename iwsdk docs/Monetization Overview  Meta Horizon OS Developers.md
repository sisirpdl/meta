## What is monetization?

Monetization features enable you to sell content or services that enhance your user’s experience. The prices for this content can be managed in the [Developer Dashboard](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/manage).

The current supported monetization features for PWAs include [In App Purchases (IAP)](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/resources/add-ons/), with the support of Subscriptions coming soon.

These features can all be managed in the Developer Dashboard at **Monetization** > **Add-ons.**

Quest monetization features allow you to strategize engagement methods and additional revenue sources for your app after launching it to the Quest store. Decisions around monetization can help improve the discoverability and longevity of your app.

### In-App purchases (IAP)

[IAP](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/web/ps-iap/) can be used to add content to your app or offer services, passes, or rewards to users interested in purchasing additional content.

IAP can also help support games released in a free-to-play model (which is the only supported pricing model for PWAs) by allowing users access to the app for free, then offering IAP content to support the app via additional monetization.
