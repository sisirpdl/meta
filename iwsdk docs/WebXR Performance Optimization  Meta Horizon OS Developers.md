Optimizing your WebXR experience requires a solid understanding of the way the Meta Quest hardware works, being comfortable with a variety of tools, and a systematic approach to profiling and validating possible optimizations.

This section contains the following pages:

-   [Performance Optimization Workflow](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/web/webxr-perf-workflow/) - Outlines a structured approach to diagnosing the common performance bottlenecks within WebXR applications.-   [WebXR performance Tools](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/web/webxr-perf-tools/) - Identifies several important tools that can help you dig deeper into specific performance problems.-   [Performance Best Practices](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/web/webxr-perf-bp/) - Provides a list of recommendations and things to watch out for when building WebXR experiences for Meta Quest headsets.-   [Fixed Foveated Rendering](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/web/webxr-ffr/) - Provides an overview of Fixed Foveated Rendering, how it can mitigate specific rendering performance problems, and what some of the tradeoffs are.-   [Multiview WebGL Rendering](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/web/web-multiview/) - Describes how to take advantage of multiview rendering extensions supported by Browser.-   [WebXR App Framerate Control](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/web/webxr-frames/) - Describes how to query and change the framerate of WebXR apps.-   [Using RenderDoc with Browser](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/web/webxr-perf-renderdoc/) - Describes the process of connecting RenderDoc for Oculus with Browser to capture and replay a frame.-   [Native/Unity Performance Documentation](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/unity-perf/) - Much of the information on the Native/Unity performance pages are also relevant to WebXR.
