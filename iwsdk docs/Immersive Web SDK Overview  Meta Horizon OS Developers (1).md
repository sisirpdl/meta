The Immersive Web SDK makes building immersive web experiences as approachable as traditional web development. It’s a complete collection of frameworks and tools that eliminates the steep learning curve and months of setup traditionally required for WebXR development.

## Breaking down barriers

Historically, creating immersive web experiences meant wrestling with complex 3D math, building interaction systems from scratch, and navigating fragmented WebXR APIs. Developers had to choose between spending months on infrastructure or settling for basic, non-interactive experiences.

IWSDK changes this by providing a complete foundation that handles the complexity for you, from physics and spatial audio to grab interactions and scene understanding. You can focus on building great experiences instead of reinventing the wheel.

## Built on three core pillars

### Modern architecture

Built on Three.js, the most popular JavaScript 3D library, paired with a high-performance Entity-Component-System pattern that scales from simple prototypes to complex applications. You get familiar foundations with the performance and flexibility to grow.

### Developer-first workflow

One-command setup gets you running in under a minute. Visual scene composition with Meta Spatial Editor, HTML-syntax spatial UI authoring, automated asset optimization, and built-in emulation. You can get started without VR equipment.

### Production-ready systems

Pre-built systems for everything immersive experiences need: grab interactions, locomotion, spatial audio, physics integration, and scene understanding. These systems can save you months of development time and work seamlessly together.

## What you get

-   **ECS Runtime** — High-performance Entity-Component-System pattern built on Three.js-   **XR Input** — Controller and hand tracking with automatic input visualization-   **Locomotion** — Teleport, slide, and turn systems with comfort features-   **Grab Interactions** — One-hand, two-hand, and distance grabbing out of the box-   **Spatial Audio** — 3D positional audio with automatic distance and directional effects-   **Physics** — Havok physics engine running in web workers for smooth performance-   **Scene Understanding** — Automatic AR plane/mesh detection with persistent anchoring-   **Spatial UI** — UIKit integration with HTML-like authoring for 3D interfaces-   **Asset Pipeline** — Automatic optimization and smart dependency management-   **Developer Tools** — Emulation runtime, visual editors, and debugging utilities

## Same code, two experiences

Your IWSDK applications run immersively in VR/AR headsets and automatically provide mouse-and-keyboard emulation on desktop browsers. It doesn’t require browser extensions or special setup. Anyone with a computer can develop for the immersive web.
